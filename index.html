				<p>This code is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for searching and displaying computer parts
					from the Newegg website. It utilizes several features and libraries to accomplish this task.

					<p>The code uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the HTML content of the Newegg website and extract relevant information 
					such as product names, prices, and links.</p>

					<p><b>GUI Creation:</b> The code utilizes the Tkinter library to create a GUI window that includes input fields, buttons, a treeview widget, and a scrollbar.
					User Input: The user can enter a search term in the provided entry field.</p>

					<p><b>Search Execution:</b> The user can initiate the search by clicking the "Search" button or pressing the Enter key. The code constructs the search URL based on the input and sends a request to the Newegg website to fetch the search results.
					Pagination: The code extracts the total number of result pages from the search results and iterates through each page to scrape the desired information.</p>
					
					<p><b>Data Extraction:</b> Using BeautifulSoup, the code extracts the relevant product information such as name, price, and link. It filters out any irrelevant items that do not match the search term exactly.
					Sorting and Displaying Results: The code sorts the extracted items based on their prices in ascending order and displays them in a treeview widget with columns for name, price, and link.</p>
					
					<p><b>Result Manipulation:</b> The code provides functionality to clear previous search results and allows copying the link of a selected item to the clipboard.</p>
					
					<p><b>Link Opening:</b> Double-clicking on an item in the search results opens the corresponding product page in a web browser using the webbrowser module.
					GUI Styling: The code uses the ttk module to style the GUI elements, such as the treeview widget and headings.</p>

					progress bar. They can also scrub through the song by dragging the progress indicator, allowing them
					to jump to any point in the track.</p>

					<p>Song Information Display: The player dynamically displays essential song information such as the
					song title, artist name, and album cover. This provides users with quick access to relevant details
					about the currently playing song.</p>

					</a>
				</span>
				<p>The wedding itinerary website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a beautiful and
					user-friendly way for guests to access all the important information about the wedding. The site
					features a clean and modern design, with a simple and intuitive navigation menu that allows users to
					easily find what they're looking for.

					<p>The site's main page provides an overview of the wedding, including the date, time, and location, as
					well as general information about the ceremony and reception. Guests can also access a detailed
					itinerary of the wedding events, including the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, with specific
					times and locations for each.</p>

					<p>One of the standout features of the website is the photo gallery, which provides a streamlined
					viewing experience for wedding photos. Instead of clicking through individual photos, guests can
					simply scroll through the gallery, with each picture showing up as they scroll. This makes it easy
					for guests to view all the wedding photos without having to click through multiple pages.</p>

					<p>The website is also mobile-responsive, allowing guests to access all the information on their phones
					or tablets, making it even more convenient for them to stay up-to-date with the wedding details.</p>

					<p>Overall, the wedding itinerary website you created is a great example of how HTML, CSS, and

					</a>
				</span>
				<p>The Simon Says game is a classic memory game that has been recreated using modern web technologies,
					such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a series of buttons that light up and produce
					sounds in a specific pattern, and the player must repeat the pattern correctly to progress to the
					next level.

					<p>The game includes multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty and complexity. As the player
					progresses, the game speeds up, and the pattern becomes longer, challenging the player's memory and
					reaction time.</p>

					<p>In addition to its engaging gameplay, the Simon Says game also features sound and animation effects,
					making the game more immersive and enjoyable to play. The sound effects play whenever the player
					clicks a button or gets the sequence wrong, adding to the overall excitement of the game. The
					animation effects, on the other hand, make the game more visually appealing by adding a cool
					animation to each button when it is pressed.</p>

					<p>Overall, the Simon Says game is a fun and challenging project that showcases the power of HTML, CSS,
					and JavaScript when used together. The project's features, including level progression, sound
					effects, and animation effects, make it an excellent example of what can be achieved with these web
					technologies.</p>
